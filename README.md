This repository is dedicated to those who would like to enhance their SQL skills for their careers. I have found https://www.sql-practice.com to be an educational and user-friendly website. You can now access answers along with alternative solutions for each question.

I have primarily used MySQL as the main Database Management System (DBMS). Therefore, you may encounter some queries that work in MySQL but may not be compatible with other DBMS such as SQL Server or PostgreSQL due to slight variations in syntax.

The test consists of 50 questions categorized into three levels:

-Easy
-Medium
-Hard

You can refer to the provided Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to determine what data to store, the entities, their attributes, and how entities relate to each other.
